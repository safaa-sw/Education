            <span>E-learning, also referred to as online learning or electronic learning, 
                is the acquisition of knowledge which takes place through electronic technologies and media.
                 In simple language, e-learning is defined as “learning that is enabled electronically”. 
                 Typically, e-learning is conducted on the Internet, where students can access their learning materials online at any place and time.
                  E-Learning most often takes place in the form of online courses, online degrees, or online programs.
                There are many e-learning examples out there, and we’ve covered those in greater detail in our previous articles.
